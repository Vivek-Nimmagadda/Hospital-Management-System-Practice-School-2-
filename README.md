This is a basic web application developed for Visakhapatnam Steel Plant general hospital where we can directly register the total number of patients who visited the hospital on that particular day along with the details of the doctor whom they consulted. I have used MySQL as the backend database for my project. This project was developed as a part of my 2 months internship and was submitted to BML Munjal University during my second semester.
